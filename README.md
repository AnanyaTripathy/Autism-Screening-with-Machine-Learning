# Autism-Screening-with-Machine-Learning
This project we detect Childhood Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening using Machine Learning.
In this project, we will use supervised learning to diagnose Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioural features and individual characteristics. 
More specifically, we will build and deploy a neural network using the Keras API.
